                    I attended the school of Theater, Film and Television at UCLA 
                    and obtained my bachelor's degree in 2019. My focused track was
                    sound design for live theater. While at UCLA I designed and and assisted on multiple
                    main stage shows. Post graduation I have worked as a freelance audio
                    engineer for theaters such as Geffen Playhouse and South Coast Repertory.
                    I am currently learning the practice of coding and web development through Trilogy Eduction
                    Services.
